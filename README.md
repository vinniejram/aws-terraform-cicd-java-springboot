Terraform: AWS CICD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, ECS and a Springboot App

## Description

This is a demo on how to use Terraform to deploy your AWS Infrastructure for your Java Springboot application to run as a container on ECS.

You will be able to boot your application locally using docker-compose as well as building the following infrastructure on AWS for this application:

- ALB, Target Groups, 80 and 443 Target Group Listeners, with Listener Configurations
- ACM Certificates, ACM Certificate Validation and Route53 Configuration
- CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and Deployment to ECS with EC2 as target
- Github Webhook (Pipeline will trigger on the main branch but configurable in `variables.tf`)
- ECR Repository
- ECS Container Instance with Userdata
- ECS Cluster, ECS Service and ECS Task Definition with variables
- S3 Buckets for CodePipeline and CodeBuild Cache
- RDS MySQL Instance
- SSM Parameters for RDS Password, Hostname etc, which we will place into the Task Definition as well
- IAM Roles, Policies and Security Groups

When I tested, terraform took `4m 24s` to deploy the infrastructure and when I made a commit to the `main` branch the pipeline took about 5 minutes to deploy.

## Deploy Local

Boot our application with docker-compose:

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

## Test the Application Locally

Make a request to view all cars:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/cars
[]
```

Create one car:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/api/cars -d '{"make":"bmw", "model": "m3"}'
{"id":3,"make":"bmw","model":"m3","createdAt":"2021-03-01T14:12:07.624+00:00","updatedAt":"2021-03-01T14:12:07.624+00:00"}
```

View all cars again:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/cars
[{"id":3,"make":"bmw","model":"m3","createdAt":"2021-03-01T14:12:08.000+00:00","updatedAt":"2021-03-01T14:12:08.000+00:00"}]
```

View a specific car:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/cars/3
{"id":3,"make":"bmw","model":"m3","createdAt":"2021-03-01T14:12:08.000+00:00","updatedAt":"2021-03-01T14:12:08.000+00:00"}
```

Delete a car:

```
$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:8080/api/cars/3
```

View application status:

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/status | jq .
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "database": "MySQL",
        "validationQuery": "isValid()"
      }
    },
    "diskSpace": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "total": 62725623808,
        "free": 2183278592,
        "threshold": 10485760,
        "exists": true
      }
    },
    "ping": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}
```

Or the database status individually:

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/status/db
{"status":"UP","details":{"database":"MySQL","validationQuery":"isValid()"}}
```

## Installing Terraform

For Mac:

```
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.7/terraform_0.14.7_darwin_amd64.zip
$ unzip terraform_0.14.7_darwin_amd64.zip
$ mv ./terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform
$ rm -rf terraform_0.14.7_darwin_amd64.zip
```

View the version:

```
$ terraform -version
Terraform v0.14.7
```

## Assumptions for AWS

For AWS, I have the current existing resources, which I will reference in terraform with the `data` source:

### vpc
- vpc with the name "main", which is my non default-vpc

### subnets
- 3 public subnets with tags Tier:public
- 3 private subnets with tags Tier:private

### nat gateway
- nat gw with eip for private range and added to my private routing table 0.0.0.0/0 to natgw

### rds
- subnet group with the name "private" which is linked to my private subnets

### route53
- existing hosted zone

### codestar connections 
- codestar connection linked to my github account:
- https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections
- the connection id is defined in: var.codestar_connection_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

## Required Environment Variables

Github Personal Access Token:

Head over to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a token with the following scopes:
- `admin:repo_hook`

Set the environment variable as:

```
$ export TF_VAR_github_token=${your-github-pat}
```

which will be referenced in `infra/aws/us-east-1/production/locals.tf`:

```
# locals.tf
locals {
  github_token = var.github_token
}
```

Other variables that needs replacement resides in `infra/aws/us-east-1/production/variables.tf`:

```
variable "aws_region" {}
variable "codebuild_docker_image" {}
variable "codebuild_security_group_name" {}
variable "codepipeline_build_stage_name" {}
variable "codepipeline_deploy_stage_name" {}
variable "codepipeline_source_stage_name" {}
variable "codestar_connection_id" {}
variable "container_desired_count" {}
variable "container_port" {}
variable "container_reserved_task_memory" {}
variable "ecs_cluster_name" {}
variable "ecs_container_instance_type" {}
variable "ecs_tg_healthcheck_endpoint" {}
variable "environment_name" {}
variable "github_branch" {}
variable "github_repo_name" {}
variable "github_token" {}
variable "github_username" {}
variable "host_port" {}
variable "platform_type" {}
variable "rds_admin_username" {}
variable "rds_instance_type" {}
variable "rds_subnet_group_name" {}
variable "route53_hosted_zone" {}
variable "route53_record_set" {}
variable "service_hostname" {}
variable "service_name" {}
variable "service_name_short" {}
variable "ssh_keypair_name" {}
variable "vpc_name" {}
```

Also ensure your configuration matches your setup in:
- `infra/aws/us-east-1/production/providers.tf`
- `infra/aws/us-east-1/production/terraform-state.tf`

## Notes

I am using the admin credentials for the application to use to authenticate against rds (for this demo), but you can use something like ansible and the local-exec provisioner to provision a rds username and password like rds.tf#L11-L40.

I am also using `String` as the type for SSM, if you save secret information, you should be using `SecureString` and encrypt it with KMS, but for the demo I won't be doing that.


## Deploy Infrastructure to AWS

Validate:

```
$ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

Variables isn't supported for backend, see [this issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13022#issuecomment-294262392), to use variables, you can [look at this example](https://github.com/ruanbekker/terraformfiles/tree/master/s3-backend-with-variables):

Initialize:

```
$ terraform init -input=false
```

Apply complete! Resources: 55 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Releasing state lock. This may take a few moments...

Outputs:

account_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
alb_dns = "ecs-prod-alb-xxxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
caller_arn = "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:user/x"
caller_user = "AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

~/aws-terraform-cicd-java-springboot/infra/aws/us-east-1/production main* 4m 24s
```

Now that your infrastructure is built, we can trigger our repo to start the pipeline:

```
$ git commit --allow-empty --message "trigger pipeline"
$ git push origin main
```

## A Tour through our Infra

We can see our Pipeline when you navigate to CodePipeline:

![](docs/screenshots/codepipeline-overview.png)

When you select the pipeline to see our stages:

![](docs/screenshots/codepipeline-detail-view.png)

We can view our ECS Cluster:

![](docs/screenshots/ecs-cluster-view.png)

Our task:

![](docs/screenshots/ecs-task-view.png)

And also check that our ACM Certificates was validated (but terraform did that already):

## Credit

Huge thanks to [Cobus Bernard](https://github.com/cobusbernard/aws-containers-for-beginners) for his webinar back in 2019, and for sharing his terraform source code, as I learned a LOT from him, and this example is based off his terraform structure.

Also great thanks to [callicoder](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-rest-api-tutorial-with-mysql-jpa-hibernate/) for the rest api example which this example is based off.
